# About Me
I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Tohoku University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tsugasa Ishigaki](http://www2.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/~isgk/research.html).

My research lies at the intersection of information retrieval and machine learning , mainly **personalized recommender systems**. I am also interested in explainable artificial intelligence, especially Diversity, Novelty and Explainability of recommendations based on deep learning frameworks.
