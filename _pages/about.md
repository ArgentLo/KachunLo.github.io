# About Me
I am a **Financial Analyst** at an investment company.

My research lies at the intersection of information retrieval and machine learning , mainly **Big Data Mining**. 

I am also interested in explainable artificial intelligence, especially novelty and explainability of recommendations based on deep learning frameworks. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tsugasa Ishigaki](http://www2.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/~isgk/research.html).
